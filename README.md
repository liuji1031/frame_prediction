# frame prediction

This project uses the architecture similar to "Oh, J., Guo, X., Lee, H., Lewis, R. L., & Singh, S. (2015). Action-conditional video prediction using deep networks in atari games. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28." to predict future frames in video feeds recorded during commute on the highway. We used Tensorflow API to code the model from scratch. 

Under the script folder, the ```model.py``` defines the main architecture. The ```train.ipynb``` is used for training of the model. ```Frame_Pred_test.ipynb``` is used to generate metrics of the model.
