## visual odometry 
1. Feature Extraction: Use OpenCV functions like cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack or a feature detector like SIFT/SURF/ORB to find keypoints in each frame.

2. Feature Matching: Use OpenCV functions like cv2.BFMatcher or cv2.FlannBasedMatcher to match features between consecutive frames.

3. Motion Estimation: Estimate the motion between frames using methods like optical flow (cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK) or solving the PnP problem (cv2.solvePnP).

4. Scale Resolution: Use the IMU data to resolve the scale factor of the motion estimated from the visual odometry.

5. Data Association: Synchronize the visual odometry data with the IMU data.
